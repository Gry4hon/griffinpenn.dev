                    <h3>Hi it's me, Griffin, nice to meet you</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a senior at Boise State University pursuing a Bachlors of Science in Games
                        Interactive Media and Mobile, and a minor
                        in Information Technology management. Through my time at Boise State a passion for everything
                        computer scienece grew within me. This is
                        everything from programming and coding, building computers and systems, creating custom hardware
                        for game development, and understanding
                        about how everything works within a conventional computer. I am constently striving to learn
                        more and more about the field of computer science, and
                        improve my skills when it comes to working with technology at large.

                    <p>
                        The logo is quite simple, yet I wanted it to convey who I am at my core. The logo is ment to
                        represent how I see myself,
                        the intercetion between liberal arts and technology. The brackets on either side of the pen are
                        found within the symbol for
                        coding. This being the <strong>"< / >"
                        </strong> symbol. The pen in the middle is modeled after a
                        drawing tablet pen that
                        I have known as the Wacom Cintiq 13d tablet. These two symbols being combined represent that I
                        view myself equally as a
                        designer and a programmer.

                    <p>
                        The intercetion of technology and liberal arts is a metaphorical intercetion between the
                        the power of technology and the creativity and intitiveness of liberal arts. The intercetion was
                        coined by Steve Jobs at the 2011 launch of the iPad 2, linked <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlI1MR-qNt8">here</a>,
                        in which he highlighted the importance to marry technology with the humanities. That with the
                        speed and
                        power of a device or software, so to must its design and useablility match its technological
                        power. This is where I feel I lie in the
                        field of software development, a designer for useablility and intuitiveness, and a programmer
                        that
                        focuses on performance and delivering above the expected result.

                    <h3>My Personal Programming Philosopy (PPP)</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to software development, my personal philosopy is to program before I code. The
                        difference is simple: programming is the planning and coding
                        is the execution of the plan.
                        Before I touch my keyboard, I first grab a piece of paper or my iPad and begin programming.
                        Similar to how a building or structure can be built, a plan consisting of careful measurements
                        and laying out resources is created by an architect. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This is the analogy I visualize that helps
                        with the next
                        step of
                        development: coding. Now coding is the next natrual step taken after programming, for it is
                        much like the construction crew
                        that creates the structure given the plans given to them by the architect. This process is an
                        example of
                        the intercetion I consider myself apart of, where the liberal arts is found in programming, and of course
                        the technology side is found within the coding.

                            Those who know me will probably say one thing: this guy has a lot of keyboards. It is true.
                            One of
                            my many passions happens to be building and modding custom mechanical keyboards, but why?
                            Many people will find
                            out how much I pay for some of these keyboards, and call it silly to invest in something so
                            trivial like a keyboard.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
                            Though it is a valid opition, think about it this way.

                        Simply put if I'm going to use a device or tool everyday I would want it to be of a high
                        quality. I
                        would assume many invest in a top of the line computer or car for the same reason,
                        dependability as well as
                        asthetics. The same can be said about my
                        passion for owning a higher end keyboard.

                                        I wouldn't recommend the 60% layout to beginners, because it sacrifices a lot of keys,
                                        mainly arrow keys. Regardless, it will always be my first custom keyboard and therefore has a special place in my collection.

                                        I would recommend this be a starter board for those with the extra cash to spend, otherwise there are plenty of better "budget" boards.

                                            called <a href="http://www.repc.com/aboutus.html">RE-PC</a>. It's quite the location, with an entire section of the store 
                                            dedicated to a museum of computing. The coolest part of this keyboard is of course the metal keycaps, however the useablility
                                            of the board isn't that great, so I use it as a display piece mostly.

                                    It was a gift from my loving parter to purly experiement with different mods too risky for my other keyboards, but
                                    that doesn't mean I don't show it the same care as I do for all my keyboards. It's even fully hotswappable, and on 
                                    a full sized board thats pretty rare!

                                    THE KEYCAPS HOWEVER ARE VERY SPECIAL! They where a gift from my bestest of friends for my 22nd birthday, and are what saves this 
                                    board. It is fairly good for gaming, because it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it is fully programmable with full RGB.

                                    that is meant to be above the rest. This is known as one's &#128588"ENDGAME KEYBOARD"&#128588, and this is mine. Never will I ever type on
                                    something more <em>prestine</em> than this board, and while that was hyperbole, this keyboard is submlime.
