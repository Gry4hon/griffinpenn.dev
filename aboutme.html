                    <h3>Hi it's me, Griffin, nice to meet you</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a senior at Boise State University pursuing a Bachlors of Science in Games
                        Interactive Media and Mobile, and a minor
                        in Information Technology management. Through my time at Boise State a passion for everything
                        computer scienece grew within me. This is
                        everything from programming and coding, building computers and systems, creating custom hardware
                        for game development, and understanding
                        about how everything works within a conventional computer. I am constently striving to learn
                        more and more about the field of computer science, and
                        improve my skills when it comes to working with technology at large.

                    <h3>The logo</h3>
                    <p>
                        The logo is quite simple, yet I wanted it to convey who I am at my core. The logo is ment to
                        represent how I see myself,
                        the intercetion between liberal arts and technology. The brackets on either side of the pen are
                        found within the symbol for
                        coding. This being the <strong>"
                            < />"
                        </strong> symbol. The pen in the middle is modeled after a
                        drawing tablet pen that
                        I have known as the Wacom Cintiq 13d tablet. These two symbols being combined represent that I
                        view myself equally as a
                        designer and a programmer.

                    <p>
                        The intercetion of technology and liberal arts is a metaphorical intercetion between the
                        the power of technology and the creativity and intitiveness of liberal arts. The intercetion was
                        coined by Steve Jobs
                        at the 2011 launch of the iPad 2, linked <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlI1MR-qNt8">here</a>, in which
                        he highlighted the importance to marry technology with the humanities. That with the speed and
                        power of a device or software, so to
                        must its design and useablility match its technological power. This is where I feel I lie in the
                        field
                        of software development, a designer for useablility and intuitiveness, and a programmer that
                        focuses on performance
                        and delivering above the expected result.

                    <h3>My personal philosopy</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to software development, my personal philosopy is to program before I code. The
                        difference is simple: programming is the planning and coding
                        is the execution of the plan.
                        Before I touch my keyboard, I first grab a piece of paper or my iPad and begin programming.
                        Similar to how a building or structure can be built, a plan consisting of careful measurements
                        and laying out resources is created by an architect. This is the analogy I visualize that helps
                        with the next
                        step of
                        development: coding. Now coding is the next natrual step I take after programming, for it is
                        much like the construction crew
                        that creates the structure given the plans given to them by the architect.
