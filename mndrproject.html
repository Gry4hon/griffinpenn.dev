                        This was one of three client projects I was a part of my senior year at Boise State University.

                        client projects where a chance to experience what it was like to work on a project as a team of
                        developers and designers
                        to create an app, game, or virtual experience for a professional client. This project was unique

                        I created plants and mushrooms that were used to populate the levels of the experience.
