                        This was one of three client projects I was a part of my senior year at Boise State University. The
                        client projects where a chance to experience what it was like to work on a project as a team of developers and designers
                        to create an app, game, or virtual experience for a professional client. This project was unique out of the other three I participated in,

                        known as her stage name MNDR. The task was to create a virtual reality experience that would immerse the player in the world of
                        her songs.

                        I was a part of the art team for this project, and my role involved creating asset concept art and 3D models.
                        I created plants and mushrooms that were used to populate the levels of the experience.
