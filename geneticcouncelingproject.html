                        This project was for a client that represented Boise State University's Genetic Counseling program. I was the
                        the lead developer on this project, and helped with development and publishing of the Genetic Counseling Study app.
                        The app itself was created because there is a lack of study material for Genetic Counseling student's test that
                        certifies them as a Genetic Counselor. The app was modeled after other learning apps such as Quizlet, in which the
                        the user is able to create their own quizzes with multiple choice questions. The user is also able to choose the categories
                        that the quiz is made up of, all with their own questions and answers.
